## Phase Progress
- Phase 1 (Requirements): Complete
- Phase 2 (Planning): Complete
- Phase 3 (Implementation): Not Started
- Phase 4 (Verification): Not Started
- Phase 5 (Release): Not Started

## Phase 2 Summary
- Blueprint: v1.0 created (Modular Monolith with Plugin Architecture)
- Tasks: 25 tasks across 4 milestones, 12 modules
- Token Estimates: ~579K total (~666K with 15% buffer)
- Parallel Groups: 6 identified (saves ~43h vs sequential)
- Build vs Integrate: 3 integrations (MCP SDK, Zod, Pino), 6 custom builds (fetch, auth, resilience)
- Technology Stack: Verified via Context7 (MCP SDK, Zod, Pino)
- Threat Model: STRIDE analysis with 17 threats identified
- Test Plan: 20/21 ACs automated, 70% min / 85% target coverage
- API Contracts: 39 MCP tools across 8 modules (20 read, 19 write)

## Context Summary

- **Architecture Pattern**: Modular Monolith (Plugin Architecture)
- **Domain**: Cloud / API Integration
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript/Node.js >=20, MCP SDK ^1.12.x, Zod ^3.24.x, Pino ^9.x, vitest
- **Key ADRs**:
  - ADR-001: Modular Monolith over Microservices
  - ADR-002: Native fetch over axios/node-fetch
  - ADR-003: Strategy Pattern for Authentication
  - ADR-004: Tool Registration at Startup (not runtime auth)
  - ADR-005: Pino over Winston/Bunyan
  - ADR-006: MCP SDK v1.x API (server.tool)
- **Modules**: Generic, Knowledge (Priority 1), Incident, Change, Problem, CMDB, Catalog, User
- **Quality Thresholds**: Coverage >=70%, Security 0 C/H, AC 100%

## Next Phase Entry

## Token Budget for Phase 3
- **Estimated Total**: ~666K tokens (with buffer)
- **By Milestone**: M1 (271K), M2 (104K), M3 (130K), M4 (161K)
- **By Model**: Haiku (82K, 6 tasks), Sonnet (497K, 19 tasks)
- **Sessions Needed**: 1 (fits within 800K usable per Sonnet session)

## Open Blockers
