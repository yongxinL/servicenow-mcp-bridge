## Phase Progress
- Phase 1 (Requirements): Complete
- Phase 2 (Planning): Not Started
- Phase 3 (Implementation): Not Started
- Phase 4 (Verification): Not Started
- Phase 5 (Release): Not Started

## Context Summary
Phase 1 complete. Locked Specification v1.0 ready for approval (includes user clarifications).

- **One-Line Requirement**: A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in Node.js/TypeScript that provides secure, modular, and production-ready access to ServiceNow REST APIs for AI assistants and automation tools, with feature-flag-driven module enablement, multi-strategy authentication, and configurable write-operation controls.
- **Functional Requirements**: 26 items (11 High, 10 Medium, 5 Low)
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: 9 items
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 21 items (12 High priority)
- **Competitors Analyzed**: 2 Python-based servers (reference only — TypeScript implementation)

### User Clarifications
1. **TypeScript-Only**: Python servers are reference/inspiration only — no code porting
2. **Write Controls**: Per-module `allow_write` flags control create/update/delete tools
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling for empty results, HTTP 403/404/400, network errors
4. **Module Priority**: Knowledge Base module is Priority 1 (implement before Incident Management)

## Lazy Load Map
- locked-specification → docs/specifications/locked-specification.md
- competitive-analysis → docs/analysis/competitive-analysis.md
- one-line-requirement → docs/specifications/one-line-requirements.md

## Completed Milestones
- One-line requirement formulated
- Competitive analysis completed (2 competitors)
- Locked Specification v1.0 created and locked

## Required Context for Phase 2
- Functional requirements list (FR-001 to FR-024)
- Non-functional requirements list (NFR-001 to NFR-008)
- Acceptance criteria (AC-001 to AC-018)
- Technical constraints (TC-001 to TC-006)
- Technology decisions: Node.js/TypeScript, MCP SDK v1.x, Zod, pino, vitest

## Next Action Plan
1. Load Phase 2 prompt: `.CodeMaestro/prompts/02-planning.md`
2. Read locked specification (lazy load from path above)
3. Begin architecture design and task breakdown

## Open Blockers
None
